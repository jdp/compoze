<h1 id="the-compozers-guide">The Compozer's Guide</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Compoze programming language is a concatenative language,
like Forth, Joy, or Factor. At their core, these languages all have
the same semantics: programs are made of composable functions, and
function composition in these languages is achieved through
concatenation.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>The Compoze syntax is intentionally minimal. It is the result of
mixing and matching from existing constructs in other languages,
the result being a clean and familiar syntax. At the highest level,
a Compoze program is made of <strong>words</strong> and
<strong>quotations</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="words">Words</h3>
<p>A Compoze word, also called a <strong>combinator</strong>, acts
like a function in other programming languages, the difference
being that its only input and output is the stack. A word applies
some transformation to the stack.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>dup</code> word places a duplicate of the
top-most item on the stack on the stack.</p>
<pre>
<code>cz&gt; 9 dup
# stack is now 9, 9
</code>
</pre>
<p>Another word, the <code>swap</code> combinator, swaps the two
top-most items on the stack.</p>
<pre>
<code>cz&gt; 13 69 swap
# stack is now 69, 13
</code>
</pre>
<h3 id="quotations">Quotations</h3>
<p>A quotation can be thought of as an anonymous function. A
quotation is created by surrounding a group of words with square
brackets, and they can be nested to arbitrary depth. Once a
quotation is created, it is pushed to the stack, and the words and
other quotations inside of it are not evaluated.</p>
<pre>
<code>[ 13 dup ]
</code>
</pre>
<h2 id="objects">Objects</h2>
<p>In Compoze, every value is an <strong>object</strong>. Compoze
has a protype-based object system, meaning that every object
descends from a single parent object. There is no "class" concept
in Compoze, only inheritance.</p>
<h3 id="messages">Messages</h3>
<p>Messages are pieces of data sent to objects that they may
respond to. In truth, words are treated as message sends to the
top-most item on the stack. In the rare event that a message is
sent to an empty stack, the Dictionary global object receives the
message.</p>

<pre>
<code>program = element (space | element)+ eof
element = word | quotation
word = identifier space*
quotation = '[' (element space*) ']' space*
