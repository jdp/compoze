compoze, a concatenative language

aims

  % simple
  
    compoze is intended to be as simple as
    possible while still being useful. any words
    that aren't totally necessary probably will
    not be built-ins.
  
  % embeddable
  
    it should be trivial to make an application
    scriptable with compoze.
  
  % hackable
  
    the source should be clean, clear, well-
    organized, and documented. this encourages
    participation in the development of the
    language.
  
current status

    
  % quotations
  
    compoze has quotations. any words between
    square brackets will be pushed to the stack
    as an anonymous function, and are callable
    with the call word.
    
  % numbers
  
    numbers are recognized and pushed onto the
    stack, but there aren't any words to perform
    operations on them.
