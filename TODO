% More words!

% Splitting of the parser into a lexer and a parser. At first I did not think
  that it was necessary, but the parser is growing a little too complex for
  my own taste.
  
% Maybe some sort of experimental object system? I like the "everything is an
  object" idea, that saves the pain of writing a bunch of x_to_y converters
  for primitives, I can just write >float and >int methods, a la Factor.
